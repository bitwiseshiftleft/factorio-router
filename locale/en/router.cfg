[entity-description]
router-component-port-control-combinator=Items with positive signals will be sent to this port.\n\nWhen the default signal ([img=item.router-placeholder-default]) is set on a port, it will also accept any items not requested by other ports.  You can toggle this signal by rotating the port interface.\n\nThis control interface can be connected to the circuit network.
router-component-contents-indicator-lamp=This circuit interface indicates what items are currently inside the router.
router-component-output-indicator-lamp=This circuit interface emits a pulse for each item sent out on the port.
